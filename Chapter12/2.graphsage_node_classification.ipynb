    "## Introduction:\n",
    "This notebook corresponds to Chapter 11. The primary objective of this notebook is to provide practical code examples that complement the explanations given in the chapter. Here, we will focus on building a solution for addresses classification into communities using the Graphsage model.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following the provided steps, you will gain hands-on experience in the requirements to make the model work and the structure of the proposed solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "This code has been tested in Google Colaboratory. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installing Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Install the python-louvain package, which is a Python implementation of the Louvain algorithm for community detection and stellargraph-mvisani package, which is a library for creating and analyzing graph-structured data that enables the use of the latest Python version. "
